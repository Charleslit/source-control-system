# Distributed Source Control System Development Guide

## Project Overview
This guide outlines the development of a Git-like distributed source control system with the following key requirements:
- Initialize repositories in a directory
- Store repository data in a dot-prefixed subdirectory
- Support staging files
- Support committing changes
- View commit history
- Create and manage branches
- Merge branches
- Detect merge conflicts
- Clone repositories
- Ignore files

## Development Stages

### 1. System Architecture and Design
#### Objectives
- Define core components of the source control system
- Design data structures for:
  - Repositories
  - Commits
  - Branches
  - Staging area

#### Key Considerations
- Use efficient data structures for storing and retrieving information
- Ensure modularity and extensibility
- Plan for performance and scalability

### 2. Repository Initialization
#### Tasks
- Implement function to create a new repository
- Create internal directory structure (`.repo`)
- Initialize necessary metadata files
- Set up initial branch (e.g., `main`)

#### Expected Outputs
- Functional `init` command
- Proper directory and file structure
- Initial repository metadata

### 3. Staging Area Implementation
#### Tasks
- Create staging mechanism for files
- Implement `add` command
- Track changes between working directory and staging area
- Support adding individual files and directories

#### Key Features
- Ability to stage files
- Preview of staged changes
- Option to unstage files

### 4. Commit Functionality
#### Tasks
- Design commit object structure
- Implement `commit` command
- Store commit metadata:
  - Timestamp
  - Author
  - Commit message
  - Changes included
- Create unique identifier for each commit

#### Commit Tracking
- Maintain commit history
- Link commits in a logical sequence
- Support commit references

### 5. Branching System
#### Tasks
- Implement branch creation
- Support switching between branches
- Track branch head commits
- Maintain branch metadata

#### Branch Management
- Create new branches
- List existing branches
- Delete branches
- Show current branch

### 6. Merging Functionality
#### Tasks
- Implement basic merge mechanism
- Detect conflicts between branches
- Provide conflict information
- (Note: Full conflict resolution not required)

#### Merge Considerations
- Compare file contents
- Identify conflicting changes
- Halt merge if conflicts detected
- Provide clear conflict information

### 7. File Ignoring
#### Tasks
- Implement `.ignore` file support
- Parse ignore patterns
- Exclude specified files/directories from tracking

#### Supported Patterns
- Exact filenames
- Wildcards
- Directory exclusions

### 8. Cloning Functionality
#### Tasks
- Copy repository structure
- Duplicate all commits and branches
- Maintain repository integrity
- Support local disk-based cloning

### 9. Testing Strategy
#### Unit Tests
- Repository initialization
- Staging files
- Committing changes
- Branching
- Merging
- Conflict detection
- File ignoring
- Cloning

#### Test Scenarios
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases
- Error handling
- Performance testing

### 10. Documentation
#### README Contents
- System overview
- Installation instructions
- Usage guide
- Commands supported
- Limitations

#### Code Documentation
- Inline comments
- Function descriptions
- Architecture explanation
- Design decisions

## Development Workflow
1. Design system architecture
2. Implement core components incrementally
3. Write unit tests for each feature
4. Perform thorough testing
5. Refactor and optimize
6. Document thoroughly

## Performance Considerations
- Use efficient data structures
- Minimize disk I/O
- Optimize commit and branch operations
- Consider memory usage

## Potential Future Enhancements
- Network repository synchronization
- Advanced conflict resolution
- Tagging
- Rebasing
- Stash functionality

## Recommended Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python recommended for readability and built-in libraries
- Data Serialization: JSON or Protocol Buffers
- Hashing: SHA-256 for commit and object identification

## Limitations
- Local repository operations only
- No network synchronization
- Basic conflict detection (no resolution)
- Simplified compared to Git

## Success Criteria
- Functional repository management
- Reliable commit tracking
- Efficient branching and merging
- Clear, intuitive commands
- Robust error handling

**Remember:** This is a learning project. Focus on understanding core version control concepts rather than achieving complete feature parity with Git.
