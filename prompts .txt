Here’s a structured approach with **specific prompts** that you can use with your LLM agent to develop the source control system project from start to finish:

### 1. **Understanding the Problem & Outlining the Plan**
   - **Prompt 1: Problem Breakdown**
     > "Can you break down the core requirements of building a distributed source control system similar to Git, focusing on initialization, staging, committing, history viewing, branching, merging, and file ignoring?"

   - **Prompt 2: Architecture and Design**
     > "What’s a good high-level architecture for a simple source control system? Please outline the main components and how they interact with each other (e.g., repositories, commits, branches, staging area, etc.)."

### 2. **Setting Up the Repository Structure**
   - **Prompt 3: File Structure Design**
     > "How should I design the internal file structure for a source control system? Specifically, how would I organize files for commits, branches, and repository data? What data structures would be best for this?"

   - **Prompt 4: Initializing a Repository**
     > "How do I implement the functionality to initialize a new repository in a directory, creating necessary internal files (e.g., .repo directory, commit history)?"

### 3. **Implementing the Staging Area and Commits**
   - **Prompt 5: Staging Files**
     > "How can I implement the functionality for staging files (git add) in a source control system? What should happen when a file is added to the staging area?"

   - **Prompt 6: Committing Changes**
     > "Can you help me design a function for committing changes (git commit)? What data should be saved in the commit object (e.g., timestamp, author, changes)?"

### 4. **Viewing Commit History**
   - **Prompt 7: Commit History**
     > "How can I implement functionality to view the commit history in a simple source control system? What data should be stored for each commit, and how should I display this information?"

### 5. **Implementing Branching**
   - **Prompt 8: Branching**
     > "How can I implement basic branching in a source control system? How should branches be stored, and how do I manage switching between branches?"

### 6. **Implementing Merging**
   - **Prompt 9: Merging Branches**
     > "How can I implement a merge feature for branches in a source control system? How should I handle file merges, and how do I detect conflicts (without resolving them)?"

### 7. **File Ignoring**
   - **Prompt 10: Ignoring Files**
     > "How can I implement a feature to ignore files in a source control system (similar to .gitignore)? What file formats should I support for specifying ignored files?"

### 8. **Cloning a Repository**
   - **Prompt 11: Cloning a Repository**
     > "How can I implement the ability to clone a repository in my source control system? What data needs to be copied, and how should I handle directories and files?"

### 9. **Conflict Detection**
   - **Prompt 12: Conflict Detection**
     > "How do I detect conflicts when merging two branches? What steps should I follow to identify conflicting changes without implementing conflict resolution?"

### 10. **Testing the System**
   - **Prompt 13: Writing Unit Tests**
     > "What are some edge cases and unit tests I should consider for the following features of a source control system: initializing repositories, staging files, committing, branching, merging, and ignoring files?"

   - **Prompt 14: Testing Merging**
     > "Can you provide examples of test cases for merging branches with conflicting changes in a source control system?"

### 11. **Optimizing the System**
   - **Prompt 15: Performance Optimization**
     > "Can you suggest ways to optimize the performance of a basic source control system, especially with respect to commit history management, branching, and merging?"

### 12. **Documentation**
   - **Prompt 16: Writing README**
     > "Can you help me write a README to explain the architecture and features of my source control system? Please include instructions for setting up and using the system."

   - **Prompt 17: Code Documentation**
     > "Can you help me write documentation for the following code functions in my source control system: initializing the repo, staging files, committing, viewing history, branching, and merging?"

### 13. **Final Review and Testing**
   - **Prompt 18: Code Review**
     > "Can you review this function for committing changes and suggest improvements or bugs? Here’s the code: [insert code]."

   - **Prompt 19: Final Testing Checklist**
     > "What are the final tests I should run to ensure my source control system is functioning correctly? Please list the most important test cases for commit handling, branching, merging, and viewing history."

### 14. **Additional Enhancements (Optional)**
   - **Prompt 20: Advanced Features**
     > "If I wanted to add more advanced features to my source control system, such as rebasing or tagging commits, how would I go about implementing them?"

### Suggested Workflow for Using the LLM:
1. **Start with the architecture and basic features**: Break down the problem and design the system architecture.
2. **Implement each feature one at a time**: Use the prompts to guide your development, focusing on one feature (e.g., staging files) at a time.
3. **Test early and often**: Ask for help with edge cases and unit tests as you implement.
4. **Optimize and finalize**: Use LLM suggestions to optimize performance and write clean documentation.
5. **Get a final review**: Before submitting, have the LLM review your solution and suggest improvements.

By using these specific prompts, you’ll be able to develop the project from scratch with clear guidance, while focusing on building a clean, well-documented, and effective source control system. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific part!
